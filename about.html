      <h3>Nick Proctor</h3>
      <p>
        I'm Nick Proctor, a Junior studying Games and Interactive Media at Michigan State University. I am also minoring in Game Design and Development.
        I am from Canton, Michigan, where I've lived most of my life. I have three siblings - two younger brothers and an older sister, as well as two dogs
        and two cats.
